# Ansible Role: AWX (open source Ansible Tower)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Eimert/ansible-role-awx.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Eimert/ansible-role-awx)

Installs and configures [AWX](https://github.com/ansible/awx), the open source version of [Ansible Tower](https://www.ansible.com/tower).

### WIP: disfunctional at the moment
working on integrating inventory functionality.

## Requirements

Before this role runs, assuming you want the role to completely set up AWX using it's included installer, you need to make sure the following AWX dependencies are installed:

    see `requirements.yml`.

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

    awx_repo: https://github.com/ansible/awx.git
    awx_repo_dir: "~/awx"
    awx_version: devel
    awx_keep_updated: yes
    awx_secret_key: awxsecret
    pg_hostname: postgresql
    pg_password: awxpass
    pg_database: awx
    pg_port: 5432
    default_admin_user: admin
    # WIP: specific variables for each environment in the inventory files.
    default_admin_password: password
    inventory_file: inventory


Variables to control what version of AWX is checked out and installed.

    awx_run_install_playbook: yes

By default, this role will run the installation playbook included with AWX (which builds a set of containers and runs them). You can disable the playbook run by setting this variable to `no`.

## Dependencies

Depends on the roles defined in `requirements.yml`.

## Example Playbook

    - hosts: awx-centos
      become: yes

      vars:
        nodejs_version: "6.x"
        pip_install_packages:
          - name: docker-py
        pg_hostname: postgresql

      roles:
        - geerlingguy.repo-epel
        - geerlingguy.git
        - geerlingguy.ansible
        - geerlingguy.docker
        - geerlingguy.pip
        - geerlingguy.nodejs
        - eimert.awx

After AWX is installed, you can log in with the default username `admin` and password `password`.

## Development setup

Fork or `git clone git@github.com:Eimert/ansible-role-awx.git`.
Local:
    ansible-galaxy install -p ./roles -r ./requirements.yml
    create example playbook: `awx.yml`.
